### Hello! 👋

I work in the applied biostatistics group at the [Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://ki.se/en/meb), [Karolinska Institutet](https://ki.se/).

I enjoy working with human genetic data, including tasks in statistical analysis, research computing, and data management.
